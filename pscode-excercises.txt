d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

A. 

Enter number 

N1 n2 n3 n4 n5 

Print n 

B. 

N1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5 + / 5 = sum 

Print sum 

C. 

If n is smaller than n1- 5 it is small

If n is larger than n1-5 it is large 

D. 
	print Average 
	
	print the number entered is larger than the other s, large"
	print the number entered is smaller than the others , small "
